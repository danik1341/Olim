                    <ol>
                      <li>Seek assistance in a language you understand: When dealing with banks or financial institutions in Israel, try to find representatives who can communicate with you in a language you are comfortable with. English is commonly spoken, but services may also be available in Russian, French, Spanish.</li>
                      <li>Check the language availability of bank apps: Before choosing a bank, inquire whether their mobile application is available in a language you understand. This will facilitate your financial transactions and make it easier to manage your accounts.</li>
                      <li>Adjust to the high cost of living: Keep in mind that Israel has a relatively high cost of living, especially when it comes to food and housing. Be prepared for these expenses and plan your budget accordingly.</li>
                      <li>Language preferences for bank SMS: Check with your bank to ensure that you can receive SMS notifications in a language you understand. This will help you stay informed about your account activity and transactions.</li>
                      <li>Understand documents in Hebrew: When signing any documents in Hebrew, don't hesitate to ask for a detailed explanation of their contents. Make sure you fully comprehend the terms and conditions before signing, and don't let any language barrier prevent you from understanding the agreements you are entering into.</li>
                      <li>Utilize multilingual ATMs and machines: Most ATMs and similar machines in Israel, such as Rav-Kav machines for public transportation, offer language options including Hebrew, Russian, French, and English. Take advantage of these options to conduct transactions conveniently and comfortably.</li>
                      <li>Be cautious about freezing of accounts: It is important to note that both the government and banks in Israel may freeze accounts, even when there is no wrongdoing involved. This is especially true if you receive money from abroad that originates from an account not owned by the same person as the receiving account. Therefore, it is advisable to spread your funds across multiple accounts and exercise caution to avoid any inconvenience.</li>
