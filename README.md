The Quick Handbook For The Ole Hadash

Created by Daniel and Gabriel

The project we have created is a website aimed for Olim Hadashim, the new immigrants of Israel. This website aims at helping the new immigrant at situationing him/herself better in his/her new or upcoming environment. Basic necessities such as emergency phone numbers will seem foreign to the new individual and our site aims to lessen the confusion caused by moving to a new country. 
We have included a number of sections explaining and/or providing information to our new Israeli brothers and sisters but we couldn’t cover every single detail. We encourage each and every Ole Hadash to ask as many questions as he can and do his own due diligence and research everything thoroughly.



In Our Website You Will Find -

* A quick explanation of what to do before and after arriving in Israel, such as 
 - Planning your Alyah
 - Consulting with your Jewish agencies
 - Visiting the Ministry of Interior
 - And more
* A few examples of Phone operators and Internet Providers where we 
 - Present the top three cellphone operators and internet providers
